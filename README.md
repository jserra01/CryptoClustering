# CryptoClustering

## Name
UCF Data Analysis - Module 19 Challenge: Unsupervised Learning

## Description
Use unsupervised learing tools (KMeans, PCA) to evaluate stock portfolio performance and identfiy clusters

Analysis consists of:
* Importing Cryto Currency data from csv file
* Preparing the data and normalizing the data
* Using the elbow technique to identify the optimal value of k
* Using K-Means to cluster the data
* Optimizing the analysis with PCA
* Comparing the outcome of both methods

## Conclusions/Answers:
* Best Value for k: Using the elbow method it appears to be 4
* Total explained variance using PCA: 89.50%
* Best Value for k when using PCA data: It appears to be 4
* Does it differ from original data: No difference

## Project status
Project has been completed and submitted for grading for the 2023 UCF Data Analysis and Visualization course.
